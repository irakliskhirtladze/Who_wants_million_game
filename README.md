# Who_wants_million_game

Popular 'Who wants to be a millionaire' game in Python. This game functions as intended, however it still needs to be polished.

Comments for exammple will be clearer and more descriptive soon.
I feel that functions can be reworked as well, I especially dislike use of global variables, but that's what I came up with so far.
Questions file 'general_questions.txt' contains questions and choices in a form of dictionary and I plan to make it encrypted.
I will change other stuff as I continue working on it. Probably I'll create GUI version as well soon.

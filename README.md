# Who_wants_million_game

Popular 'Who wants to be a millionaire' game in Python. This game is console base and functions as intended, however it needs to be polished.

Comments, for example, should be clearer and more descriptive.

Functions should be reworked as well. I especially dislike use of global variables.
To get rid of so many global variables, I will need to use OOP approach (I think).

The file 'general_questions.txt' contains questions and choices in a form of dictionary. The first choice is always the correct one!
Of course the contents of the file should be encrypted, but this is just for demonstration purposes at the time.

Thanks and hope you won't be too critical :D
